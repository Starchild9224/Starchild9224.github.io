        <p>
            Atlassian is renowned for its outstanding collaboration tools and project management software, delivering efficient and innovative solutions trusted by professionals worldwide. As collaboration becomes increasingly important in academic settings, there is a growing opportunity to extend Atlassian's influence to student communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            To address this need while maintaining a consistent brand identity, a new web-based application — Colla — is being developed specifically for student teams. Colla is designed to facilitate seamless collaboration, introduce workplace-relevant tools early in the academic journey, and support a smoother transition into professional environments. All the features highlighted in this project are intended to provide Atlassian with actionable design directions and user-centered solutions that reflect student needs and align with the brand's tone and values.
        </p>
        <p>
            By introducing Atlassian tools early in their journey, Colla is aiming to empower students to work smarter and with greater purpose — enabling deeper connections, meaningful teamwork, and long-term growth.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Design Process</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">A user-centered approach</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of asking users what they want directly, why not try listening to their feelings first? With Atlassian's value “Don't #@!% the customer” in mind, The team created a user-centered survey asking about their feelings about team collaboration first and then trying to figure out the pain points. With users at the center of our work, we analysed how they performed their actions towards the tasks that needed to be done to hypothesis about their motivations. The team conducted multiple rounds of tests within the group, constantly revising the questions, and finally developed a questionnaire and semi-structured interview questions that were key to our subsequent research and design.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
            <p>
                We used the Affinity Diagram method to categorize user feedback, uncover key pain points, and distill core problems. This approach efficiently guided our design focus and direction.

            <h3>01. Simple Interface</h3>
            <p>The simpler the workflow, the faster our new users can get started. We are committed to simplifying task processes to minimize users' time learning how to use it, make the design capture the younger generation, and keep up with today's design trends.</p>

            Based on background research of Atlassian products, competitor analysis and user research, the team summarised our design opportunities and directions as

    <h2 class="section-heading">User testing process</h2>
    <h3 class="section-subheading">Shut up and let the users do the talking </h3>
    <p>
        Directive language has a far more powerful impact on user behaviour than imagined. For untrained testers, a few simple explanations or clarifications can alter their behaviour. Therefore, during the user testing phase, we assign tasks to users and then employ the 'think aloud' method, encouraging users to express their thoughts as they navigate through the interface. Simultaneously, we observe their behavioural patterns in specific tasks, such as clicking and browsing habits, aiming to comprehend how users interact with the interface and their preferences. This is a cost-effective and efficient user testing method at the current stage as a student.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Take user's perspective collectively, not just a handful </h3>
        <p>
            We received input from individuals across various disciplines. From these feedbacks, we've identified consistent suggestions as well as unique insights. Based on this, we prioritized the feedback using the MoSCoW method, pinpointing the most pressing areas for improvement. Through iterative processes, we refined these areas, ensuring that the focus of iterations remained undistorted by individual feedback.

                    The "progress track bar" solution allows users to understand their tasks not only clearly but also swiftly review the progress of team members and projects. From the progress overview on the team's main page to detailed progress within each task, the team can constantly monitor task progress. The task list facilitates quickly adding tasks and marking them as complete, updating progress at any time. Users can also jump to Trello to view tasks from various teams, enhancing connectivity among Atlassian's products.

                    Introducing the intelligent group assistant is the focal point of our premium features, serving as a tool to swiftly organize teams, create events, and set event reminders. Among these, the most noteworthy is our group meeting availability recommendation. Through @Colla's smart assistant and by sending #my availability, it automatically extracts and integrates available time slots, significantly saving discussion time within the group. It's an extremely practical solution for both smaller teams and larger groups with more members.
