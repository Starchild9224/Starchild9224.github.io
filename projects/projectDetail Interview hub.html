        <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Interview Hub is a user-centered platform that designed to streamline interview preparation, focusing on intuitive navigation, clear content hierarchy, and an engaging, stress-free user experience. I led the end-to-end design process for this project, from initial concept and user research to interactive high-fidelity prototypes and final design documentation for handoff. The design includes:
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3 class="section-subheading">User Interface: </h3> Browsing and filtering interview questions, editing answers, customizing personal question sets, and daily review check-ins
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3 class="section-subheading">Admin Panel: </h3> Managing content and updating the question database for user to catch up with the newest interview information. Manage user's account information and review comments and posts made by user to maintain a friendly online community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through user research and iterative design, I created low-fidelity sketches and gradually evolved them into a functional hi-fi prototype. During development, I conducted Cognitive Walkthroughs to identify usability issues and ensure the interface met user expectations. The final deliverables included a complete developer-ready design specification.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Admin Side Design Challenges and Issues</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Pixels are perfect—until they hit production </h3>
        <p>
            Admin side design often consider functions over appearance. While design explores the ideal, implementation often needs balance with technical realities —including storage structure, code efficiency, system performance, and reusability—ensuring that the final product remains robust, maintainable, and scalable. Based on UX design principles, this also requires designers to have a certain level of understanding of code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through cognitive walkthrough user testing with developers, several previously overlooked issues were identified:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, compared to creating a new page, pop-ups provide weaker protection against errors related to information storage. Data entered into a pop-up is more vulnerable to loss if the user refreshes or navigates away, whereas a new page structure offers greater stability across page transitions.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Second, from a development complexity perspective, implementing modals may be more complicated in terms of frontend interaction and state management.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Third, when form contents vary significantly, the reusability of pop-ups is limited, resulting in lower development efficiency.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Take the content input box as an example: drawing on my UX experience and the current project requirements, I have summarized the following input methods.
