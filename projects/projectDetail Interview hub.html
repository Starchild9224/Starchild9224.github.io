        <p>
            Atlassian is renowned for its outstanding collaboration tools and project management software, providing efficient and innovative business solutions and earning accolades from many professionals. However, our products have limited use among students. To familiarize our users with our products early on and facilitate a smoother transition from student to workforce, we are currently focused on designing a new web-based application that will help student teams collaborate effectively and align our products with the workplace. Our mission is to make work more simple and more meaningful, enabling better connections and growth.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Admin Side Design Challenges and Issues</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Pixels are perfect—until they hit production </h3>
        <p>
            Admin side design often consider functions over appearance. While design explores the ideal, implementation often needs balance with technical realities —including storage structure, code efficiency, system performance, and reusability—ensuring that the final product remains robust, maintainable, and scalable. Based on UX design principles, this also requires designers to have a certain level of understanding of code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through cognitive walkthrough user testing with developers, several previously overlooked issues were identified:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, compared to creating a new page, pop-ups provide weaker protection against errors related to information storage. Data entered into a pop-up is more vulnerable to loss if the user refreshes or navigates away, whereas a new page structure offers greater stability across page transitions.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Second, from a development complexity perspective, implementing modals may be more complicated in terms of frontend interaction and state management.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Third, when form contents vary significantly, the reusability of pop-ups is limited, resulting in lower development efficiency.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Take the content input box as an example: drawing on my UX experience and the current project requirements, I have summarized the following input methods.
