        <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Interview Hub is a user-centered platform that designed to streamline interview preparation, focusing on
            intuitive navigation, clear content hierarchy, and an engaging, stress-free user experience. I led the
            end-to-end design process for this project, from initial concept and user research to interactive
            high-fidelity prototypes and final design documentation for handoff. The design includes:
        </p>
        <div class="inline-wrapper">
            <h3 class="section-subheading">User Interface: </h3>
            <p>
                Browsing and filtering interview questions, editing answers, customizing personal question sets, and
                daily review check-ins
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="inline-wrapper">
            <h3 class="section-subheading">Admin Panel: </h3>
            <p>
                Managing content and updating the question database for user to catch up with the newest interview
                information. Manage user's account information and review comments and posts made by user to maintain a
                friendly online community.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Through user research and iterative design, I created low-fidelity sketches and gradually evolved them into
            a functional hi-fi prototype. During development, I conducted Cognitive Walkthroughs to identify usability
            issues and ensure the interface met user expectations. The final deliverables included a complete
            developer-ready design specification.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Admin Side Design Challenges</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Pixels are perfect—until they hit production </h3>
        <p>
            Admin side design often consider functions over appearance. While design explores the ideal, implementation
            often needs balance with technical realities —including storage structure, code efficiency, system
            performance, and reusability—ensuring that the final product remains robust, maintainable, and scalable.
            Based on UX design principles, this also requires designers to have a certain level of understanding of
            code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through cognitive walkthrough user testing with developers, several previously overlooked issues were
            identified:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, compared to creating a new page, pop-ups provide weaker protection against errors related to
                information storage. Data entered into a pop-up is more vulnerable to loss if the user refreshes or
                navigates away, whereas a new page structure offers greater stability across page transitions.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Second, from a development complexity perspective, implementing modals may be more complicated in terms
                of frontend interaction and state management.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Third, when form contents vary significantly, the reusability of pop-ups is limited, resulting in lower
                development efficiency.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Take the content input box as an example: drawing on my UX experience and the current project requirements,
            I have summarized the following input methods.
        </p>

    <section class="project-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">The iteration & solution</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Iteration of the admin panel input dialog </h3>
        <p>
            By integrating options directly into the user workflow and visualise unnecessary explanation , the modal
            content is streamlined, improving its code reusability during development. It also increased user interface
            consistency and better maintained the same standard.
        </p>
        <img class="full-width-image" src="../assets/interview hub project/iteration detail2.png"
            alt="Full-width project image" />

        <div class="two-column-grid">
            <div class="two-column">
                <p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Refining the Add-Question Interface</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Replacing the modal with a dedicated “Add Question” page reduces the risk of accidental interactions
                    and unintended closures. It also clarifies the page hierarchy, enhances error prevention, and
                    enables more efficient back-end data processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, a full-page interface improves task focus and reduces user errors. Unlike modals—which
                    often feel temporary and easy to dismiss—a dedicated page conveys task importance and encourages
                    more deliberate input. This is particularly effective for multi-step or cognitively demanding
                    actions like writing detailed questions, helping to improve completion rates and reduce form
                    abandonment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an accessibility perspective, full pages offer better support for screen readers and keyboard
                    navigation, ensuring compliance with WCAG standards and providing a smoother experience for users
                    with diverse needs.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Design system development </h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Design for reuse, not just for now </h3>
        <p>
            Creating a design system was not just a matter of visual consistency — it was a strategic move to scale design efficiency and improve cross-team collaboration.Instead of documenting UI at the screen level, I focused on breaking interfaces down into modular, reusable components that could serve across products.
        </p>
        <p>
            While working on the later-stage updates and maintenance of the first SaaS product, I began building a foundational design system to streamline future design and development efforts. I created a reusable component library that captured the visual tone and interaction patterns aligned with our brand — enabling consistency not only across existing features, but also in upcoming platforms. <br>
            This system became a powerful asset in the design and development of the second product,which is this Interview Hub. By leveraging established components and design decisions, I was able to move faster while ensuring visual and experiential cohesion across products. More importantly, the system laid a scalable foundation for future projects for the company, allowing my design work to remain effective and relevant beyond individual product cycles.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Impact & Value</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Streamlined Practice Flow </h3>
        <p>Users can efficiently search, filter, and solve questions while tracking their answers. In user testing, participants completed a standard 10-question set 12% faster compared to other prep platforms through user testing, citing clearer navigation and less repetitive interaction.</p>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">Active & Personalized Learning </h3>
            <p>
                Features like answer comparison, peer insights, and custom collections support deeper understanding and tailored review strategies.This collective learning environment fosters a sense of peer connection, transforming practice from a solitary task into a shared, evolving experience.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
            <p>“Most interview prep platforms are quite functional but lack interaction. Being able to read other users' answers and see shared real-life interview experiences would really motivate me to keep practicing.”

        </div>
        <h3 class="section-subheading"> Motivating User Experience </h3>
            <p>
                Gamification elements and a personalized profile dashboard encourage consistency, turning a traditionally tedious task into an engaging habit-building journey.
