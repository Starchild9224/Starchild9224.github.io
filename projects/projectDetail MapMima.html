        <p>
            Nestled along the scenic shores of Lake Macquarie, MAP Mima (Multi-Arts Pavilion) stands as a symbol of artistic potential within a verdant recreational park. Despite its strategic location, this cultural hub has largely gone unnoticed by the public. In an effort to draw more attention to the site, Ignite the Sparks utilizes the pre-existing Catenary lighting structure outside the Mima hub, turning it into an interactive lighting installation.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">
            Cherishing sunsets, togetherness, and all the beautiful moments worth capturing. </h3>
        <p>
            For thousands of years, people have gathered and lived on the land of Lake Macquarie, creating cherished moments and memories - from the stories that the Awabakal people have passed down to the serene sunsets and water reflections that bring people together after another precious day.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the heart of Ignite the Sparks lies a design concept that seeks to capture the fleeting beauty of transient moments, such as sunsets and fireworks. The project is crafted to encourage playful exploration, invoking positive emotions, warmth, and a sense of connection. As night descends, the installation comes to life, extending the allure of the sunset through a dynamic play of lights. With a user-friendly mobile app, visitors become co-creators, customizing and collectively illuminating the Catenary with digital fireworks. This installation not only enriches the outdoor space but also draws visitors, fostering a vibrant and inviting atmosphere that complements MAP Mima's minimal design.

                    Use appropriate sizing, spacing, and vibrant colours as visual cues to guide users' attention and emphasize key information. By incorporating large colour blocks, I want to establish a clear visual hierarchy while also creating an interface that feels playful and engaging.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">From Solo Spark to Shared Glow: An Interactive Lighting Experience </h3>
        <p>
            The design features an engaging mobile interface that empowers users to interact with the lighting installation seamlessly. The controlling signals are sent to the backend of the installation through wifi.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3 class="section-subheading">Passive Mode </h3>
            In moments of inactivity, the lighting installation gracefully transitions into a fluid sunset backdrop. The vertical poles gradually illuminate in a rhythmic breathing pattern, casting a warm and inviting ambiance that encourages exploration. These gentle breathing lights serve as a focal point during the passive mode, intuitively guiding visitors and enticing them to engage further.
        </p>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading">Individual Interaction Mode </h3>
                    Upon selecting a launch point and their preferred firework colour via the mobile interface, users are given two ignition options. They can either hold the button for a continuous firework display or click for a single firework. Each ignition triggers a distinct firework display generated randomly in one of three modes: rings, rays, or sparkles. This element of unpredictability brings dynamism to the visual experience, ensuring that every interaction is a uniquely creative and engaging event.

                    The design cultivates collaborative experiences for multiple users, allowing them to share the launch pole. Each successive user chooses a unique colour, adding their individual touch to the collective display. As more participants join, a vibrant array of fireworks emerges. Our design promotes interaction among visitors, fostering an atmosphere where people collectively revel in moments of joy and amusement.

        <p>
<h3 class="section-subheading">🎉 Playful · Igniting Imagination through Interaction </h3>
At the heart of this project is a joyful, hands-on experience. By offering an intuitive interface to create and launch digital fireworks, we invite people of all ages to explore and express their creativity. The playful nature of this feature transforms public space into a canvas of imagination and wonder.
<h3 class="section-subheading">💡 Functional & Practical · Lighting with Purpose and Beauty </h3>
Beyond being an interactive artwork, this installation also serves as a functional lighting fixture along MAP mima's main road. Its lighting design balances utility and aesthetics—providing safe, sufficient illumination while enhancing the night-time visual experience with thoughtful transitions and ambient sunset color palettes.
<h3 class="section-subheading">🏘 Community & Public Space · Fostering Connection in Shared Environments</h3>
“Ignite the Sparks” is deeply rooted in community values. Through group interaction modes and collaborative participation, the project strengthens emotional ties among individuals and reinforces a shared sense of place. It demonstrates how lighting can do more than illuminate—it can connect, engage, and revitalize public space.
