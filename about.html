                I really appreciate your patience in going through my portfolio up to this point.
                <br><br>
                I'm a UI/UX Designer and artist based in Sydney, Australia, currently holding a 5-year working visa
                effective from 2025 onwards, with 3+ years of professional experience in UI/UX design overseas and in
                Sydney . I'm currently working full-time after graduating from my master's degree in Interaction Design
                and Electronic Arts & Illumination Design from the University of Sydney.
                <br><br>
                I am a strategic thinker, problem solver, and collaborator who is passionate about human-centred design
                and digital transformation.I believe that a good designer should champion user experience and drive
                innovation, which ultimately comes down to understanding people. Graduating with a Bachelor of Science
                degree in Psychology and Visual Arts has given me a unique and insightful perspective on design. I'm
                dedicated to creating engaging and seamless experiences and always eager to explore and learn new
                things. ðŸ˜Š
                <br><br>
                If you're interested in working with me, feel free to reach out!
