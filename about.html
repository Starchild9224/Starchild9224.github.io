        <h1>Hi there</h1>
        <p>
            I really appreciate your patience in going through my portfolio up to this point.

            I'm a UX/UI Designer and artist based in Sydney, Australia, currently holding a 5-year working visa effective from 2025 onwards, with 3+ years of professional experience in UI/UX design overseas and in Sydney . I'm currently working full-time after graduating from my master's degree in Interaction Design and Electronic Arts & Illumination Design from the University of Sydney.
            
            I am a strategic thinker, problem solver, and collaborator who is passionate about human-centred design and digital transformation.I believe that a good designer should champion user experience and drive innovation, which ultimately comes down to understanding people. Graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology and Visual Arts has given me a unique and insightful perspective on design. I'm dedicated to creating engaging and seamless experiences and always eager to explore and learn new things. ðŸ˜Š
            
            If you're interested in working with me, feel free to reach out!
